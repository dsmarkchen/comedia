To course across more kindly waters now
my talent's little vessel lifts her sails,
leaving behind herself a sea so cruel;

and what I sing will be that second kingdom,
in which the human soul is cleansed of sin,
becoming worthy of ascent to Heaven.

But here, since I am yours, o holy Muses,
may this poem rise again from Hell's dead realm;
and may Calliope rise somewhat here,

accompanying my singing with that music
whose power struck the poor Pierides
so forcefully that they despaired of pardon.

The gentle hue of oriental sapphire
in which the sky's serenity was steeped--
its aspect pure as far as the horizon--

brought back my joy in seeing just as soon
as I had left behind the air of death
that had afflicted both my sight and breast.

The lovely planet that is patroness
of love made all the eastern heavens glad,
veiling the Pisces in the train she led.

Then I turned to the right, setting my mind
upon the other pole, and saw four stars
not seen before except by the first people.

Heaven appeared to revel in their flames:
o northern hemisphere, because you were
denied that sight, you are a widower!

After my eyes took leave of those four stars,
turning a little toward the other pole,
from which the Wain had disappeared by now,

I saw a solitary patriarch
near me--his aspect worthy of such reverence
that even son to father owes no more.

His beard was long and mixed with white, as were
the hairs upon his head; and his hair spread
down to his chest in a divided tress.

The rays of the four holy stars so framed
his face with light that in my sight he seemed
like one who is confronted by the sun.

"Who are you--who, against the hidden river,
were able to escape the eternal prison?"
he said, moving those venerable plumes.

"Who was your guide? What served you both as lantern
when, from the deep night that will always keep
the hellish valley dark, you were set free?

The laws of the abyss--have they been broken?
Or has a new, a changed decree in Heaven
let you, though damned, approach my rocky slopes?"

My guide took hold of me decisively;
by way of words and hands and other signs,
he made my knees and brow show reverence.

Then he replied: "I do not come through my
own self. There was a lady sent from Heaven;
her pleas led me to help and guide this man.

But since your will would have a far more full
and accurate account of our condition,
my will cannot withhold what you request.

This man had yet to see his final evening;
but, through his folly, little time was left
before he did--he was so close to it.

As I have told you, I was sent to him
for his deliverance; the only road
I could have taken was the road I took.

I showed him all the people of perdition;
now I intend to show to him those spirits
who, in your care, are bent on expiation.

To tell you how I led him would take long;
it is a power descending from above
that helps me guide him here, to see and hear you.

Now may it please you to approve his coming;
he goes in search of liberty--so precious,
as he who gives his life for it must know.

You know it--who, in Utica, found death
for freedom was not bitter, when you left
the garb that will be bright on the great day.

Eternal edicts are not broken for us;
this man's alive, and I'm not bound by Minos;
but I am from the circle where the chaste

eyes of your Marcia are; and she still prays
to you, o holy breast, to keep her as
your own: for her love, then, incline to us.

Allow our journey through your seven realms.
I shall thank her for kindness you bestow--
if you would let your name be named below."

"While I was there, within the other world,
Marcia so pleased my eyes," he then replied,
"each kindness she required, I satisfied.

Now that she dwells beyond the evil river,
she has no power to move me any longer,
such was the law decreed when I was freed.

But if a lady come from Heaven speeds
and helps you, as you say, there is no need
of flattery; it is enough, indeed,

to ask me for her sake. Go then; but first
wind a smooth rush around his waist and bathe
his face, to wash away all of Hell's stains;

for it would not be seemly to approach
with eyes still dimmed by any mists, the first
custodian angel, one from Paradise.

This solitary island, all around
its very base, there where the breakers pound,
bears rushes on its soft and muddy ground.

There is no other plant that lives below:
no plant with leaves or plant that, as it grows,
hardens--and breaks beneath the waves' harsh blows.

That done, do not return by this same pass;
the sun, which rises now, will show you how
this hillside can be climbed more easily."

With that he vanished; and without a word,
I rose and drew in closer to my guide,
and it was on him that I set my eyes.

And he began: "Son, follow in my steps;
let us go back; this is the point at which
the plain slopes down to reach its lowest bounds."

Daybreak was vanquishing the dark's last hour,
which fled before it; in the distance, I
could recognize the trembling of the sea.

We made our way across the lonely plain,
like one returning to a lost pathway,
who, till he finds it, seems to move in vain.

When we had reached the point where dew contends
with sun and, under sea winds, in the shade,
wins out because it won't evaporate,

my master gently placed both of his hands--
outspread--upon the grass; therefore, aware
of what his gesture and intention were,

I reached and offered him my tear--stained cheeks;
and on my cheeks, he totally revealed
the color that Inferno had concealed.

Then we arrived at the deserted shore,
which never yet had seen its waters coursed
by any man who journeyed back again.

There, just as pleased another, he girt me.
O wonder! Where he plucked the humble plant
that he had chosen, there that plant sprang up

again, identical, immediately.

By now the sun was crossing the horizon
of the meridian whose highest point
covers Jerusalem; and from the Ganges,

night, circling opposite the sun, was moving
together with the Scales that, when the length
of dark defeats the day, desert night's hands;

so that, above the shore that I had reached,
the fair Aurora's white and scarlet cheeks
were, as Aurora aged, becoming orange.

We still were by the sea, like those who think
about the journey they will undertake,
who go in heart but in the body stay.

And just as Mars, when it is overcome
by the invading mists of dawn, glows red
above the waters' plain, low in the west,

so there appeared to me--and may I see it
again--a light that crossed the sea: so swift,
there is no flight of bird to equal it.

When, for a moment, I'd withdrawn my eyes
that I might ask a question of my guide,
I saw that light again, larger, more bright.

Then, to each side of it, I saw a whiteness,
though I did not know what that whiteness was;
below, another whiteness slowly showed.

My master did not say a word before
the whitenesses first seen appeared as wings;
but then, when he had recognized the helmsman,

he cried: "Bend, bend your knees: behold the angel
of God, and join your hands; from this point on,
this is the kind of minister you'll meet.

See how much scorn he has for human means;
he'd have no other sail than his own wings
and use no oar between such distant shores.

See how he holds his wings, pointing to Heaven,
piercing the air with his eternal pinions,
which do not change as mortal plumage does."

Then he--that bird divine--as he drew closer
and closer to us, seemed to gain in brightness,
so that my eyes could not endure his nearness,

and I was forced to lower them; and he
came on to shore with boat so light, so quick
that nowhere did the water swallow it.

The helmsman sent from Heaven, at the stern,
seemed to have blessedness inscribed upon him;
more than a hundred spirits sat within.

"In exitu Israel de Aegypto,"
with what is written after of that psalm,
all of those spirits sang as with one voice.

Then over them he made the holy cross
as sign; they flung themselves down on the shore,
and he moved off as he had come--swiftly.

The crowd that he had left along the beach
seemed not to know the place; they looked about
like those whose eyes try out things new to them.

Upon all sides the sun shot forth the day;
and from mid--heaven its incisive arrows
already had chased Capricorn away,

when those who'd just arrived lifted their heads
toward us and said: "Do show us, if you know,
the way by which we can ascend this slope."

And Virgil answered: "You may be convinced
that we are quite familiar with this shore;
but we are strangers here, just as you are;

we came but now, a little while before you,
though by another path, so difficult
and dense that this ascent seems sport to us."

The souls who, noticing my breathing, sensed
that I was still a living being, then,
out of astonishment, turned pale; and just

as people crowd around a messenger
who bears an olive branch, to hear his news,
and no one hesitates to join that crush,

so here those happy spirits--all of them--
stared hard at my face, just as if they had
forgotten to proceed to their perfection.

I saw one of those spirits moving forward
in order to embrace me--his affection
so great that I was moved to mime his welcome.

O shades--in all except appearance--empty!
Three times I clasped my hands behind him and
as often brought them back against my chest.

Dismay, I think, was painted on my face;
at this, that shadow smiled as he withdrew;
and I, still seeking him, again advanced.

Gently, he said that I could now stand back;
then I knew who he was, and I beseeched
him to remain awhile and talk with me.

He answered: "As I loved you when I was
within my mortal flesh, so, freed, I love you:
therefore I stay. But you, why do you journey?"

"My own Casella, to return again
to where I am, I journey thus; but why,"
I said, "were you deprived of so much time?"

And he: "No injury is done to me
if he who takes up whom--and when--he pleases
has kept me from this crossing many times,

for his own will derives from a just will.
And yet, for three months now, he has accepted,
most tranquilly, all those who would embark.

Therefore, I, who had turned then to the shore
at which the Tiber's waters mix with salt,
was gathered in by his benevolence.

Straight to that river mouth, he set his wings:
that always is the place of gathering
for those who do not sink to Acheron."

And I: "If there's no new law that denies
you memory or practice of the songs
of love that used to quiet all my longings,

then may it please you with those songs to solace
my soul somewhat; for--having journeyed here
together with my body--it is weary."

"Love that discourses to me in my mind"
he then began to sing--and sang so sweetly
that I still hear that sweetness sound in me.

My master, I, and all that company
around the singer seemed so satisfied,
as if no other thing might touch our minds.

We all were motionless and fixed upon
the notes, when all at once the grave old man
cried out: "What have we here, you laggard spirits?

What negligence, what lingering is this?
Quick, to the mountain to cast off the slough
that will not let you see God show Himself!"

Even as doves, assembled where they feed,
quietly gathering their grain or weeds,
forgetful of their customary strut,

will, if some thing appears that makes them fear,
immediately leave their food behind
because they are assailed by greater care;

so did I see that new--come company--
they left the song behind, turned toward the slope,
like those who go and yet do not know where.

And we were no less hasty in departure.




## 24

Our talking did not slow our pace, our pace
not slow our talking; but conversing, we
moved quickly, like a boat a fair wind drives.

And recognizing that I was alive,
the shades—they seemed to be things twice dead—drew
amazement from the hollows of their eyes.

And I, continuing my telling, added:
"Perhaps he is more slow in his ascent
than he would be had he not met the other.

But tell me, if you can: where is Piccarda?
And tell me if, among those staring at me,
I can see any person I should note."

"My sister—and I know not whether she
was greater in her goodness or her beauty—
on high Olympus is in triumph; she

rejoices in her crown already," he
began, then added: "It is not forbidden
to name each shade here—abstinence has eaten

away our faces." And he pointed: "This
is Bonagiunta, Bonagiunta da
Lucca; the one beyond him, even more

emaciated than the rest, had clasped
the Holy Church; he was from Tours; his fast
purges Bolsena's eels, Vernaccia's wine."

And he named many others, one by one,
and, at their naming, they all seemed content;
so that—for this—no face was overcast.

I saw-their teeth were biting emptiness—
both Ubaldin da la Pila and Boniface,
who shepherded so many with his staff.

I saw Messer Marchese, who once had
more ease, less dryness, drinking at Forli
and yet could never satisfy his thirst.

But just as he who looks and then esteems
one more than others, so did I prize him
of Lucca, for he seemed to know me better.

He murmured; something like "Gentucca" was
what I heard from the place where he could feel
the wound of justice that denudes them so.

"O soul," I said, "who seems so eager to
converse with me, do speak so that I hear you,
for speech may satisfy both you and me."

He answered: "Although men condemn my city,
there is a woman born—she wears no veil
as yet-because of whom you'll find it pleasing.

You are to journey with this prophecy;
and if there's something in my murmuring
you doubt, events themselves will bear me out.

But tell me if the man whom I see here
is he who brought the new rhymes forth, beginning:
‘Ladies who have intelligence of love.'"

I answered: "I am one who, when Love breathes
in me, takes note; what he, within, dictates,
I, in that way, without, would speak and shape."

"O brother, now I see," he said, "the knot
that kept the Notary, Guittone, and me
short of the sweet new manner that I hear.

I clearly see how your pens follow closely
behind him who dictates, and certainly
that did not happen with our pens; and he

who sets himself to ferreting profoundly
can find no other difference between
the two styles." He fell still, contentedly.

Even as birds that winter on the Nile
at times will slow and form a flock in air,
then speed their flight and form a file, so all

the people who were mere moved much more swiftly,
turning away their faces, hurrying
their pace because of leanness and desire.

And just as he who's tired of running lets
his comrades go ahead and slows his steps
until he's eased the panting of his chest,

so did Forese let the holy flock
pass by and move, behind, with me, saying:
"How long before I shall see you again?"

"I do not know," I said, "how long I'll live;
and yet, however quick is my return,
my longing for these shores would have me here

sooner—because the place where I was set
to live is day by day deprived of good
and seems along the way to wretched ruin."

"Do not be vexed," he said, "for I can see
the guiltiest of all dragged by a beast's
tail to the valley where no sin is purged.

At every step the beast moves faster, always
gaining momentum, till it smashes him
and leaves his body squalidly undone.

Those wheels," and here he looked up at the sky,
"do not have long to turn before you see
plainly what I can't tell more openly.

Now you remain behind, for time is costly
here in this kingdom; I should lose too much
by moving with you thus, at equal pace."

Just as a horseman sometimes gallops out,
leaving behind his troop of riders, so
that he may gain the honor of the first

clash—so, with longer strides, did he leave us;
and I remained along my path with those
two who were such great marshals of the world.

And when he'd gone so far ahead of us
that my eyes strained to follow him, just as
my mind was straining after what he'd said,

the branches of another tree, heavy
with fruit, alive with green, appeared to me
nearby, just past a curve where I had turned.

Beneath the tree I saw shades lifting hands,
crying I know not what up toward the branches,
like little eager, empty—headed children,

who beg—but he of whom they beg does not
reply, but to provoke their longing, he
holds high, and does not hide, the thing they want.

Then they departed as if disabused;
and we—immediately—reached that great tree,
which turns aside so many prayers and tears.

"Continue on, but don't draw close to it;
there is a tree above from which Eve ate,
and from that tree above, this plant was raised."

Among the boughs, a voice—I know not whose—
spoke so; thus, drawing closer, Virgil, Statius,
and I edged on, along the side that rises.

It said: "Remember those with double chests,
the miserable ones, born of the clouds,
whom Theseus battled when they'd gorged themselves;

and those whom Gideon refused as comrades—
those Hebrews who had drunk too avidly—
when he came down the hills to Midian."

So, keeping close to one of that road's margins,
we moved ahead, hearing of gluttony—
its sins repaid by sorry penalties.

Then, with more space along the lonely path,
a thousand steps and more had brought us forward,
each of us meditating wordlessly.

"What are you thinking of, you three who walk
alone?" a sudden voice called out; at which
I started—like a scared young animal.

I raised my head to see who it might be;
no glass or metal ever seen within
a furnace was so glowing or so red

as one I saw, who said: "If you'd ascend,
then you must turn at this point; for whoever
would journey unto peace must pass this way."

But his appearance had deprived me of
my sight, so that—as one who uses hearing
as guide—I turned and followed my two teachers.

And like the breeze of May that-heralding
the dawning of the day—when it is steeped
in flowers and in grass, stirs fragrantly,

so did I feel the wind that blew against
the center of my brow, and clearly sensed
the movement of his wings, the air's ambrosia.

And then I heard: "Blessed are those whom grace
illumines so, that, in their breasts, the love
of taste does not awake too much desire—

whose hungering is always in just measure."

## 25

The hour when climbers cannot pause had come:
the sun had left to Taurus the meridian,
and night had left it to the Scorpion.

Therefore, like one who will not stop but moves
along his path, no matter what he sees,
if he is goaded by necessity,

we made our way into the narrow gap
and, one behind the other, took the stairs
so strait that climbers there must separate.

And as the fledgling stork will lift its wing
because it wants to fly, but dares not try
to leave the nest, and lets its wing drop back,

so I, with my desire to question kindled
then spent, arrived as far as making ready
to speak. But my dear father, though our steps

were hurrying, did not stop talking, for
he said: "The iron of the arrow's touched
the longbow; let the shaft of speech fly off."

Then I had confidence enough to open
my mouth and ask him: "How can one grow lean
where there is never need for nourishment?"

"If you recall how Meleager was
consumed," he said, "just when the firebrand
was spent, this won't be hard to understand;

and if you think how, though your body's swift,
your image in the mirror captures it,
then what perplexed will seem to you transparent.

But that your will to know may be appeased,
here's Statius, and I call on him and ask
that he now be the healer of your doubts."

"If I explain eternal ways to him,"
Statius replied, "while you are present here,
let my excuse be: I cannot refuse you."

Then he began: "If, son, your mind receives
and keeps my words, then what I say will serve
as light upon the how that you have asked.

The thirsty veins drink up the perfect blood—
but not all of that blood: a portion's left,
like leavings that are taken from the table.

Within the heart, that part acquires power
to form all of another's human limbs,
as blood that flows through veins feeds one's own limbs.

Digested yet again, that part descends
to what is best not named; from there it drips
into the natural receptacle,

upon another's blood; the two bloods mix,
one ready to be passive and one active
because a perfect place, the heart, prepared them.

The active, having reached the passive, starts
to work: first it coagulates—and then
quickens-the matter it has made more dense.

Having become a soul (much like a plant,
though with this difference—a plant's complete,
whereas a fetus still is journeying),

the active virtue labors, so the fetus
may move and feel, like a sea-sponge; and then
it starts to organize the powers it's seeded.

At this point, son, the power that had come
from the begetter's heart unfolds and spreads,
that nature may see every limb perfected.

But how the animal becomes a speaking
being, you've not yet seen; this point's so hard,
it led one wiser than you are to err

in separating from the possible
intellect the soul, since he could see
no organ for the mind—so did he teach.

Open your heart to truth we now have reached
and know that, once the brain's articulation
within the fetus has attained perfection,

then the First Mover turns toward it with joy
on seeing so much art in nature and
breathes into it new spirit—vigorous—

which draws all that is active in the fetus
into its substance and becomes one soul
that lives and feels and has self-consciousness.

That what I say may leave you less perplexed,
consider the sun's heat that, when combined
with sap that flows from vines, is then made wine.

And when Lachesis lacks more thread, then soul's
divided from the flesh; potentially,
it bears with it the human and divine;

but with the human powers mute, the rest—
intelligence and memory and will—
are more acute in action than they were.

With no delay, the soul falls of itself—
astonishingly—on one of two shores;
there it learns—early—what way it will journey.

There, once the soul is circumscribed by space,
the power that gives form irradiates
as-and as much as—once it formed live limbs.

And even as the saturated air,
since it reflects the rays the sun has sent,
takes rainbow colors as its ornament,

so there, where the soul stopped, the nearby air
takes on the form that soul impressed on it,
a shape that is, potentially, real body;

and then, just as a flame will follow after
the fire whenever fire moves, so that
new form becomes the spirit's follower.

Since from that airy body it takes on
its semblance, that soul is called ‘shade': that shape
forms organs for each sense, even for sight.

This airy body lets us speak and laugh;
with it we form the tears and sigh the sighs
that you, perhaps, have heard around this mountain.

Just as we are held fast by longings and
by other sentiments, our shade takes form:
this is the cause of your astonishment."

By now we'd reached the final turning we
would meet and took the pathway right, at which
we were preoccupied with other cares.

There, from the wall, the mountain hurls its flames;
but, from the terrace side, there whirls a wind
that pushes back the fire and limits it;

thus, on the open side, proceeding one
by one, we went; I feared the fire on
the left and, on the right, the precipice.

My guide said: "On this terrace, it is best
to curb your eyes: the least distraction—left
or right—can mean a step you will regret."

Then, from the heart of that great conflagration,
I heard "Summae Deus clementiae"
sung—and was not less keen to turn my eyes;

and I saw spirits walking in the flames,
so that I looked at them and at my steps,
sharing the time I had to look at each.

After they'd reached that hymn's end, "Virum non
cognosco" were the words they cried aloud;
then they began the hymn in a low voice

again, and, done again, they cried: "Diana
kept to the woods and banished Helice
after she'd felt the force of Venus' poison."

Then they returned to singing; and they praised
aloud those wives and husbands who were chaste,
as virtue and as matrimony mandate.

This is—I think—the way these spirits act
as long as they are burned by fire: this is
the care and this the nourishment with which

one has to heal the final wound of all.
